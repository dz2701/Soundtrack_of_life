<br/>

<p>Sentimental is a song about a boy who thinks about his ex-girlfriend on a sentimental day.<br/><br/>
This was the first song of the first concert that I have ever went with my friends, and along.<br/>

<br/>

<p>Sentimental is the first song in the concert that I have attended for the first time with my friends, and was one of the main events of my childhood. 
This was when I was so tired from the intense study schedule I had for the first time when I completely settled in Korea for my last year in elementary school. 
It served as a great refresher during my finals week. Although it was only a few days before the actual exam, I don’t regret going, because it definitely helped me relieve some stress and help me focus on the exam more. :D<br/></p>

<h3> 제주도의 푸른 밤 (The Night of Jeju Island) - 최성원 (Choi Seong Won) <br/></h3>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>I actually got to know this song by a cover by another artist, but it is a song about moving to Jeju Island and running away from the busy, dry life in the city. I personally at that time was very pessimistic about my life, and felt similar and listened to this music on my way back home from my math academy. In the song, he/she says “떠나요 둘이서 모든 걸 훌훌 버리고 (Let us leave together leaving everything behind)” and “도시의 침묵 보다는 바다의 속삭임이 좋아요 (I like the whispers of the sea than the silence of the city)”. Having lived in suburb China and Gyeonggi-do previously, I definitely felt the same living in the city during my middle school years.<br/></p>
