<h3> 센치해 (Sentimental) - WINNER<br/></h3>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>Sentimental is the first song in the concert that I have attended for the first time with my friends, and was one of the main events of my childhood.
<br/>This was when I was so tired from the intense study schedule I had for the first time when I completely settled in Korea for my last year in elementary school. 
<br/>It served as a great refresher during my finals week. Although it was only a few days before the actual exam, I don’t regret going, because it definitely helped me relieve some stress and help me focus on the exam more. :D<br/></p>

<h3> 제주도의 푸른 밤 (The Night of Jeju Island) - 최성원 (Choi Seong Won) <br/></h3>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>I actually got to know this song by a cover by another artist, but it is a song about moving to Jeju Island and running away from the busy, dry life in the city.<br/>At that time, I was very pessimistic about living in the city, and felt similar and listened to this music on my way back home from my math academy. <br/>In the song, he/she says “떠나요 둘이서 모든 걸 훌훌 버리고 (Let us leave together leaving everything behind)” and “도시의 침묵 보다는 바다의 속삭임이 좋아요 (I like the whispers of the sea than the silence of the city)”. <br/>Having lived in suburb China and Gyeonggi-do (suburb) previously, I definitely felt the same while living in the city during my middle school years.<br/></p>

<h3> 수고했어 오늘도 (Good Job Today) - 옥상달빛<br/></h3>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>My 7th grade year was the hardest; I was at school from 8 to 3, then I was at multiple academies until 1 AM, every day, including weekends.<br/> Even looking back from now, I don’t want to go back although without it it was impossible to catch up what we did in school.<br/> This song was a perfect reliever that soothed my soul when I was getting back home from that basement that I was taught in.<br/> It whispers, “수고했어 오늘도 (Good job today)” multiple times, as if it were to congratulate me for completing another day.<br/></p>

<h3> 결혼해 줄래 (Will You Marry Me) - 이승기<br/></h3>

<br/>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7cG4AThdsc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<br/>

<p>My second oldest sister got married two years ago, and she wanted us to sing a song for her in her wedding.<br/> So Jin and I decided to practice this song (which was commonly sang in weddings to bless the bride and groom) for them.<br/> I especially remember the phrase “평생을 사랑할게, 평생을 지켜줄게, 너만큼 좋은 사람 만난걸 감사해 (I will love you forever, keep you safe forever, I am grateful to meet you)”, because when Jin and I got to that point, she started crying.<br/> It’s indubitably one of the most important songs in my life.<br/></p>

<h3> 당신은 사랑받기 위해 태어난 사람(You were born to be loved)<br/></h3>

<br/>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MRH5oNG7hA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe></center>

<br/>

<p>This is especially important in my life, as it was the song my mother put up during my first birthday party!<br/> Of course, I don’t remember the actual event, but I have watched over and over the recordings of my first birthday and the scene where this song starts playing, and my mom and dad had a short blessing read out loud to Jin and me.<br/> Not only that, my mother often sang the phrase “당신은 사랑받기 위해 태어난 사람” from the song before I went to sleep during my childhood, which I can still remember.<br/></p>

<h3> TT - Twice<br/></h3>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>Every year in South Korean schools, we went on “educational” trips (수련회) to different parts of the country, with friends and teachers to have fun.<br/> In every 수련회, we always had an event called 레크레이션 (recreation), where it was mainly icebreakers and having fun with various activities, including group dancing and performances.<br/> TT was the song that a group performed in my very last 수련회. I can still remember one of my close friends was on stage, and we were recording and making fun of that one mistake she made. <br/></p>

<h3> Danse Macabre (Dance of Death) - Saint-Saëns<br/></h3>

<br/>

<br/>

<p>I studied in an international school in China until my fourth grade, and during the second semester of fifth grade I came back to Korea to resume my education.<br/>At first, I was super confused and unfamiliar with the new system I was in. <br/>Joining the school orchestra was one of the things to solve that; and this song was the song we practiced to join a competition, and one first place. <br/></p>

<br/>

<p>Old Reserve. This song can be said to be one of the most important music in my life.<br/> As this is the song for the high school that I attend, this song not only represents my current identity, but also brings back my memories of freshman and sophomore year.<br/> Even after I graduate, hearing the first phrase of the song, "Fair halls amidst" will bring back memories in Reserve.<br/></p>

<center><h4>Few Sidenotes...</h4></center>
<p>The order of the songs were chosen with loose chronological order and significance in life.</p><br/>
<p>This means that the songs were roughly ordered in chronological order, but the song's importance in my life takes up a larger portion in deciding where the song is located.</p>
